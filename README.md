# Command Prompt Chess

This is a mini 2-Player Chess game that allows you to play with your friends on a command line.
There is currently no AI integrated, so you have to find a friend to play with!

There is also the possibility to play on LAN with your pal.

Check [the released version](https://github.com/GmxMahdi/CMD-Chess/releases) to try it out!
